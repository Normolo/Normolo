1: The foundation was created by an anomalous entity called 'The Adminstrator'. He then proceeded to divide it into departments, so that the containment and research of SCPs can be done more effeciently. Each department, apart from it's directorate also has an overseer that is responsible for giving details regarding the department to the adminstrator.

2: I am currently in the Ethics Committee and Security Department. For the former I have been tasked with creating applications for each of the subcommittees. For the former, meanwhile, I have been asked to improve on my combat skills.

3: It will do this because with L3, I will have access to more parts of the foundation, both on and off-site. This, atleast in my case, will make me want to play and work for the foundation more, thus increasing my activity.

4: SCP-3000 is a very large 'eel' like creature that exists within the bay of bengal. Foundation ships are tasked with disawllowing poeple to go near the entity. Foundation submarines are tasked with 'feeding it' disposable class personell for it the excrete a fluid that is used to create amnestics.

5: SCP-173.
